Hoy small fry!
Looks like you got it!
As promised, I'll tell ye how to get this secret entrance to appear.
Rumor has it that it's in this here fountain.
First you must find the 4 statues, and place them upon their pedestals.
Next ye gotta turn em to face their father.
If you do all that, then something should happen.
That being said, I got nae'r clue if it be true.
Good luck me boy.
