Oiiiiii!
Looks like ye be tryin to get into the castle, wee shrimp.
Well yes, but it looks impossible.
Not. Impossible. I know a way in! A secret way.
...
......
BUT! I need help first.
Ok what do you need?
You see, I be a fisherman.
*He sounds more like a pirate...*
But my tacklebox was taken by guards, and was hidden over in that castle garden.
Without it I am nothing. *sob*
I have been looking for a thief, you looks light on your feet!
Ok, I'll help... Not like I have much choice.
Yaaaaaarg! That be the spirit, anchovie boy!
I'll get you across this here bridge, you'll be able to reach the garden after you pass through the courtyard.
Watch this sonny!
