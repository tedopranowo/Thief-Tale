Hey, I'm trying to get into the castle, can you point me in the right direction?
Sorry little girl, king's is about to give his new clothes address. His majesty will not be seeing any buggars like you today.
Wait I'm not -
Listen m'am, you're gonna have to wait until tomorrow if you wanna see the King.
Now wait one minute, I will have you know -
Listen, I'm busy 'ere. Beat it kid.
...
Why do I even -
And I better not catch you snooping around them castle grounds below, either.
