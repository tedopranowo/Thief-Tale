Why is all your fruit bruised?
Since the King started taxing everything all I can afford is this cheap rope.
This morning it snapped and my whole shipment came tumbling down.
I'm sorry to hear that. Here, I'll take these apples. They should still be good for making pie.
Thank you miss. I really appreciate it.
Please, call me Mary.

If you have time, after I close up my shop, would you like to go for a walk?
That would be lovely.
